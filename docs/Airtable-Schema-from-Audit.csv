Student Roster,Each record corresponds to one student,idN,Formula,,,"Student ID number, which is a unique identifier that corresponds to each student. These are important for a lot of different functions and automations",This just outputs the contents of the '🔢 Serial ID Multiplier' field which is also a formula field that outputs the contents of the 'Student Serial ID' field multiplied by 7. The reason for multiplying by 7 was to make it so not every single number corresponded to a student in case tutors had errors entering the student ID when uploading a video that could lead to misattribution of the video.,users,,no,yes,
Student Roster,Each record corresponds to one student,🔢 Serial ID Multiplier,Formula,,,Redundant student ID field that has the exact same contents as idN,calculated by multiplying 'Student Serial ID' field by 7,users,,no,?,

Student Roster,Each record corresponds to one student,Date Signed Up,Date and time,,,Includes the date and time for when the user first signed up,,users,,no,yes,
Student Roster,Each record corresponds to one student,Special Modifier,Percentage,,,"Field that tells us the multiplier for the tutor's base tutoring payment when they work with the student. This exists because some students sign up for premium tutoring which is a more white glove experience and the tutor is compensated extra for these students. In other cases, particularly difficult students will warrant a higher rate for the tutor. This is usually somewhere between 100% and 150% but can be higher",multiplies by the tutor base pay to calculate the tutor rate for tutoring meetings,students,,no,yes,
Student Roster,Each record corresponds to one student,Student Status - Exam,Single Select,,"MCAT, GRE, DAT, OAT, USMLE, ACT, SAT, IB, AP, LSAT, NBME",Indicates which exam the student is preparing for,The vast majority of these are MCAT but can be a useful datapoint if the student is not preparing for the MCAT and needs to see a different set of things upon logging in.,students,,no,yes,

Student Roster,Each record corresponds to one student,Payer Name,Single line text,,,Name of the payer or parent who signed the student up for a consultation or service,"Our payment links include a spot for Student Name and Student Email Address that is separate from the fields for name and email address of the payer. Often the parent will sign their kid up and put their own name and email here. We include this field to track that information.

Student Roster,Each record corresponds to one student,Payer Email,Email,,,Email address of the payer or parent who signed the student up for a consultation or service,,payer_parent,,no,yes,
Student Roster,Each record corresponds to one student,Number of installments,Number,,,Number of installments included in the person's payment plan,"Written at time of sign up so could actually be used to reconstruct past sales events when we pull the data from airtable. I think it's worth try to do this using the following fields: Number of installments, Installment intervals, Installment frequency, Installment amount, Date Signed Up, Student Email, Payer Email, Salesperson......",sales,,no,yes,

Student Roster,Each record corresponds to one student,Marketing Contacts,Linked (many),Marketing Contacts,,"Marketing Contacts (described below) is a table in which each record corresponds to one student OR one parent. That means one Student Roster record could correspond to one or two Marketing Contacts records. While the fields above in student roster come at the time of purchase, the Marketing Contacts field tracks whether the payments are actually received by crawling through Stripe and compiling user-specific data every few days.",,users,This may not need to be included anywhere because much of the data is redundant but perhaps should be included on a per user basis to compare whether they actually pay,no,yes?,
Student Roster,Each record corresponds to one student,Premium tutor,Single select,,"Yes, No","If yes, then indicates the student signed up for premium tutoring which comes at a higher (often negotiated) hourly rate. This will impact the 'Special Modifier' field",,students,likely needs to be a number field that indicates the number of premium tutoring hours the student has signed up for. We currently just have one tutoring hours field but we might need two to avoid future confusion.,no,yes,
Student Roster,Each record corresponds to one student,Onboarding Survey Printout,URL,,,URL for a google doc that includes the results of the student's onboarding survey they take at the time when they sign up. This helps tutors see what the student needs early on,,students,We'll probably replace this technique but for now the results of the survey can be excellent data for the student AI to get started.,no,yes,
Student Roster,Each record corresponds to one student,Test Date (linked),Linked (one),Test Dates,,Indicates the day the student will take the MCAT,,students,This is very important for us to know the student's test date to help them choose a course and work through their study plan to hit their goals.

","If the student has Comprehensive 1, Comprehensive 2, or Comprehensive 3, in this field and DO NOT HAVE 'Bootcamp' in the 'Bootcamp Status' field, then they have access to the Comprehensive Course. 

If they do have 'Bootcamp' in the 'Bootcamp Status' field then they do not have access to the Comprehensive Course.

If they have Tutoring only then they do not have Comprehensive Course access or Bootcamp access.

We'll do this differently in the future but we should still retain this data just in case.,,students,,no,yes,
Student Roster,Each record corresponds to one student,Bootcamp Status,Single select,,"Bootcamp, No",Bootcamp' means the student has access to the Bootcamp in the Boolean variable described previously for the new schema. If this says 'Bootcamp' then it means the student certainly does NOT have comprehensive course access.,,students,"We have a variety of Bootcamps so it would be better to have a field where we indicate which bootcamp the student has access to. That said, indicating that they have signed up for the Bootcamp before isn't a bad idea but just having a boolean like this is not much information. I'm going to make the next field one that actually isn't in airtable but is how we should think about the Bootcamp moving forward",no,no,
Student Roster,Each record corresponds to one student,bootcamp_access,Linked (one),bootcamp_course,,"This is a new field (not currently in airtable) but it will completely fix the issue we have and we're going to need to take data from the current airtable setup to get this to make sense.

The bootcamp_course table will be for the Bootcamp what the Courses1 table is for the Comprehensive Course. Each record will be a separate course that students can sign up for. 

The first two courses in that list will be 'gen1_bootcamp' and 'summer2025_bootcamp'. These will link to all students who have 'Bootcamp' in their 'Bootcamp Status' field as well as 'Gen 1' or 'Summer 2025' in their 'Bootcamp Assigned' field.

The third course in the 'bootcamp_course' table will be 'wbc25' and people who have 'Bootcamp Assigned' as 'Winter 2025' will be assigned to this course cohort.
